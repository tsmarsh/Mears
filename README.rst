Introduction
============

Mears is a simple issue tracking tool.

Installation
=============

* Download in to your projects working directory
* open mears.html 

To Do
=====

Lots.  Still very early days.  Not ready for even casual use.

Want to get to the point where each bug is actually a usable HTML page.  Double click on the bug and it opens as a useful bug page, rather than just having them as JSON.

History
=======

Mears was born out the frustration of being a Dev thrown in to a project as a QA and being told that I should use Excel to track my bugs.  Given my maxim:

	Excel is an excellent tool for telling you when your development career is over.

â€¦it was clear that we needed to get out of this situation quickly.

The biggest problem we had was that Excel worked really well for our purposes

1. graphs and reports were easy;
2. it took no time to setup;
3. we could use version control to view history and share with the team.

But, it was still excel.  Patrick and I talked about this and, as web developers, realized that all we really wanted was the version control.  Why not write a web app that wrote bugs as files, back in to the version control?
